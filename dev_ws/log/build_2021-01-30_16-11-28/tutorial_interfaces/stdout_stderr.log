CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrosid1_default_generator.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "rosid1_default_generator", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "rosid1_default_generator" with any of the following names:

    rosid1_default_generatorConfig.cmake
    rosid1_default_generator-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rosid1_default_generator" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "rosid1_default_generator_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "rosid1_default_generator" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
